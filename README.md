# Pentest
Hand crafted one off templates for pentest

Source code for the numerous blunders I have caused,
Python scripts ported to Golang, a bulk of which still work.

## Get `go`ing

For a given template, put it's directory in the src directory
in `GOPATH`, modify it's endpoint URI, then run:

```bash
target=${PWD##*/}
go mod tidy
go build
./$target
```
