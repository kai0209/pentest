# Pentest
Hand crafted one off templates for pentest

These include the source code for the numerous blunders
I have caused, Python scripts I've ported to Golang, of
which some still work.

## Get `go`ing

For a given template, put it's directory in the src directory
in GOPATH, modify it's endpoint URI, then run:

```bash
target=${PWD##*/}
go build
./$target
```
